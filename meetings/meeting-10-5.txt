Everyone has Begun work on seperate pieces of the project, specifically the neccessary front end and back end
pieces for the first demo. The product class needs to be altered to include a category parameter in the table.
Discussed storing product images as file paths rather than as files in the db table. we have decided to use a token based authent-
ication system. Tasks that require admin can be authenticated by requiring the user class. Will begin to Front end develop now that 
back end is established.

Next meeting and its agenda:
The next meeting is planned to be on Oct. 12, 2018. Will discuss current state of project, reflect on the first demo, and begin
to plan for next deliverable.
